White Whale Arbitrage Bot Client Documentation

##Â Overview

The White Whale protocol is designed as an interchain liquidity platform within the Cosmos Ecosystem. Read everything about the protocol at our website: https://whitewhale.money/.
An important part of the White Whale mission is making arbitrage more accessible to the bigger crowd and the development of open-sourced arbitrage bots is one of the strategies to achieve this. 
These docs are designed as a manual for running the arbitrage bots and will contain additional information regarding the off-chain usage of the on-chain protocol (smart contracts) as well.
